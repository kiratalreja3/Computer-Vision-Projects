# Computer Vision Projects
My Computer Vision projects including image camera calibration, homography, CNNs, corner detection &amp; denoising. Here is a summary of the algorithms and techniques implemented across the included files. 

# C-Lab1
This project explores the basics of image processing. Some of the tasks performed are 
- Histogram Equalisation : Histogram equalization is a method to process images in order to adjust the contrast of an image by modifying the intensity distribution of the histogram. The objective of this technique is to give a linear trend to the cumulative probability function associated to the image.
